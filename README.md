The goals that use the **maven-release-plugin** are attached to RUN_MODES:

* RELEASE
* RELEASE_BRANCH
* RELEASE_BRANCH_RPM

It generates the `release.properties` and then the *release:prepare*-goal can be used to make the maven release-artifact.

The goals that are **native** are attached to RUNMODES:

* NATIVE
* NATIVE_BRANCH
* NATIVE_BRANCH_RPM
  
The **native**-method is developed in version: *3.0.0* to get rid of the dependency on the **maven-release-plugin**.

## Goals
